GDRouting
=========

GDRouting is a framework for using private CocoaPod repositories to modularizing a large application into sub-applications. The open source repo JLRoutes is used create x-callback-urls to glue all the sub-apps together accessible though a menu system or with string keys exposed in each sub-app.

This repo buids upon concepts taken from the blog post <a href="http://dev.hubspot.com/blog/architecting-a-large-ios-app-with-cocoapods">Using CocoaPods to Modularize a Big iOS App</a> by Anthony Roldan of HubSpot.
